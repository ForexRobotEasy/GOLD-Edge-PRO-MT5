## Product Description
GOLD Edge PRO MT5 is a professional Forex trading robot that uses a combination of moving averages and the Relative Strength Index (RSI) to identify trading opportunities. It also incorporates grid trading and news filtering features to enhance trading performance.

The robot is equipped with the following features:
- Lot Size: Allows the user to set the desired lot size for each trade.
- Stop Loss: Sets the maximum acceptable loss for each trade.
- Take Profit: Sets the target profit level for each trade.
- Moving Averages: Uses two moving averages (fast and slow) to determine the trend direction.
- RSI: Uses the RSI indicator to confirm the trend and identify overbought or oversold conditions.
- Grid Trading: Implements a grid trading strategy with a defined grid step, trailing stop, and stop loss/take profit levels.
- News Filter: Allows the user to enable a news filter to pause trading during certain days and hours.
- Position Closure: Enables automatic closure of positions based on a predefined profit level.

The robot is designed to take advantage of bullish or bearish trends identified by the moving averages. It opens long trades when the fast moving average is above the slow moving average and the RSI is above a specified level. Similarly, it opens short trades when the fast moving average is below the slow moving average and the RSI is below the specified level.

The robot also incorporates risk management features such as stop loss and take profit levels to protect the trading account. It uses a grid trading strategy to maximize profit potential and minimize drawdown.
